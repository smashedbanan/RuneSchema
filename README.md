## Downloads

The repository is source-first. Compiled RuneSchema packages, storefront UE4SS
bundles, build dependencies, hashes, and installation packages are published as
separate GitHub Release assets:

https://github.com/gh0sted5456-us/RuneSchema/releases

The universal RuneSchema runtime detects Steam/GOG and Game Pass/WinGDK
automatically. UE4SS storefront packages are distributed separately so users
do not repeatedly download the same runtime with every RuneSchema source
snapshot.

## Building

Run `Build RuneSchema.bat` from the repository root.

The builder downloads the small pinned build-dependency bundle on first use,
verifies its SHA-256 hash, and caches it under `.cache/`. CMake/UE4SS source
dependencies continue to be fetched by the normal build process. Generated
packages are written to `dist/` and are not source-controlled.

Authoring, loader, Unreal + RuneSchema, compatibility, API, and release
documentation is maintained on the public documentation site above.
