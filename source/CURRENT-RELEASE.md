# RuneSchema 0.7.7.3e experimental

RuneSchema 0.7.7.3e uses one `main.dll` for Steam/GOG and Game Pass/WinGDK.
The runtime detects the storefront at startup and selects the matching native
support automatically.

## What changed

- RuneSchema `/npc` actors are transient and excluded from world-save actor
  persistence. Older RuneSchema-owned saved NPC shells are retired without
  touching native NPCs.
- Rooted `$Clone` building definitions survive the menu-to-world boundary even
  when Unreal finalizes their transient object serial after creation. Recovery
  still requires the exact retained object, original object slot, root, and
  `BuildingPieceData` class.

- Mandatory startup pruning remains registry-driven and removes only
  persistence identities absent from their complete applicable live registry.
- Optional baseline recovery is disabled by default. It can use the baked
  appearance profile or exactly `settings/defaults/default.json`, and only
  adds missing validated records while preserving healthy live progress.
- Appearance, item, quest, and progress baseline categories have independent
  toggles. Corrupt-entry bypass remains separate and quarantined.
- `$RuntimeWidget.$TextStyle` can apply native UMG font, color, shadow, wrap,
  width, and justification fields at owner-scoped runtime events without a
  polling scan.

- RuneSchema content uses one authoring definition for standalone and
  multiplayer. NPCs no longer use a `Multiplayer` field.
- Server authority still controls gameplay changes in multiplayer; clients
  receive replicated actors and presentation.
- `/assets` clones register with the live item subsystem before recipes,
  rewards, or inventory grants use them.
- Consumable packs may be cloned from compatible native pack ItemData and may
  replace their `Items to Drop` contents.
- RuneSchema recipe unlocks may persist normally once their live RecipeData has
  a valid PersistenceID.
- Processing-station recipe placement is verified by reading the live station
  row back; rejected inserts and missing replacement targets count as errors.
- Vendor-generated recipes remain transient.
- Safe Clean removes orphaned RuneSchema identities when the supplying mod is
  no longer installed.
- Advanced logging changes log detail only; auto reload controls file watching only. Neither setting gates initial startup or loader execution.
- Unsupported files and mod-manager bookkeeping folders are ignored unless they are valid RuneSchema loader/plugin inputs.
- The networking content plugin is named `RSNetworking`. Helpy is DLL-only and does not mount PAK content.
- Steam/GOG and Game Pass use the same JSON loaders and cleanup rules while
  keeping storefront-specific native bindings separate.

## Save handling

RuneSchema does not maintain a restore history or rewrite Xbox Game Save
containers directly. Enabled content registers first. Character cleanup then
removes unresolved RuneSchema identities at the game's normal character-load
boundary and lets Dragonwilds save normally.

Removing a mod is treated as removing that content. Reinstalling it later is a
fresh installation; cleaned progress is not recreated automatically.

## Multiplayer

Authors do not choose a single-player or multiplayer mode for RuneSchema
content. Install the same mod and cooked assets on the server and clients that
need to render them. RuneSchema uses the current world role to decide authority
and presentation.

## Startup log

RuneSchema identifies itself at startup, including:

- RuneSchema version;
- detected storefront;
- selected native binding lane;
- mapping status; and
- current network role as the game becomes ready.

## Packages

- **Universal**: RuneSchema core plus optional bundled plugins.
- **Core**: RuneSchema without optional plugins.
- Use the UE4SS runtime intended for the installed Steam/GOG or Game Pass build.
